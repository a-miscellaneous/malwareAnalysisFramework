# Malware Analysis Framework

## Description

This framework automates malware analysis into feature extraction and classification. The framework is designed to be modular and easy to extend. It is written in python and uses the `scikit-learn` library for machine learning. To optimize hyperparameters `optuna` is used. It is recomended to use a virtual environment for analysis since malware is going to be extracted.
If your feature extractor is dynamic then definetly use a virtual environment.

## Usage

- clone the repository
- copy the template `template.py` into a subfolder
- rename the template to your feature extractor
- implement the `extract` function
- use the handler to analyze, train and evaluate your feature extractor
- your training and testing data should be .zip in the example folder
- labeling might need adjustment based on file names

## Example

checkout the example folder for a working example (missing the malware samples)
